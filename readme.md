## Presentation

This is a school project, one of my first "web technologies" project.
The goal of this project was to introduce to the connections between backend and frontend.

It is written with the following technologies : 
- html and css for the front
- javascript for the back
- koa web framework to create the API
- nodemon to automatically detect front changes

## How to run the code

To run the program you need to : 
- install yarn 
- run ```yarn install``` to install the dependencies. It will install koa and nodemon
- run ```yarn dev``` to actually run the code
The listened port is stored on the file /back/.env (normally port 5000).
